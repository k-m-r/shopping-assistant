# Shopping Assistant

Started this project mostly to learn about MCP.
Along the way I thought this will be a good opportunity for me to automate some of the cart building process.

They way I am planning to implement the shopping assistant is  :

There can be two broad categories of purchase.

- Weekly shopping which will involve some regular items that we buy weekly and few other items that is bought on a need basis
- I am planning to maintain a list for regular items and an option to provide an input list.
- To start with the list may look like a <item (milk)> <quantity> (Optional)
- If quantity is not mentioned, program will assume the default quantity as zero
- As we know the items we buy, I may provide a reference to the items we usually buy. example "milk" means Kroger® 2% Reduced Fat Milk Gallon


Future enhancements

- add logic to compare the unit price for items and decide which one to buy. For example is half gallon milk is on sale, choose that over gallon milk


## Development approach
As I started this project mostly for learning purpose, I am not planning to use on any AI coding assistants in the IDE
The way I am working if coming up with the details of how I would implement it and use help from Google Gemini web interface to get code snippets.

For the current use case I am working on , there may not be a need for using an LLM.
I am planning to start another project to play around with LLM based MCP server
